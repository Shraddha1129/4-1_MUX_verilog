# 4-1_MUX_verilog
A Multiplexer (MUX) is a digital switch that selects one of many input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. In particular, the 4:1 Multiplexer (4-to-1 MUX) has 4 data inputs and 2 select lines (s1, s0) that determine which one of the 4 inputs is passed to the output.
